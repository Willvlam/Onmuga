# Onmuga
Play with friends — simple multiplayer games you can run on Replit.

This project includes:

- Tic-Tac-Toe (2 players)
- Connect Four (2 players)

Run locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start: `npm start`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and create a room or join with a friend.

Run on Replit:

1. Create a new Replit and import this repository.
2. Replit will run `npm start` automatically (or set the Run command to `node server.js`).
3. Open the webview and share the room code with a friend.

Share feedback or request more games and I'll add them.
