# How to save & push changes

If the environment doesn't allow `git` operations, run these locally or in your Replit shell:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add multiplayer games, server, frontend, and Replit config"
git push origin main
```

Or run the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/save.sh "Your commit message"
```
